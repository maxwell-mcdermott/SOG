# Sherbet: sequencing data analysis pipelines

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/66501450.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/66501450)

Automated workflows for common sequencing-based (Illumina) protocols, 

such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, WGBS/RRBS methylation, whole genome/exome/targeted variant detection, contaminant screening, Cut & Tag, and Cut & Run.

All work is based off of the original SNS created by Igordot.  If someone somehow gets into this directory please cite him not me.
